> Declaration of Provisional Government

We, the State Founders of the Sovereign Order of Aether, hereby proclaim the establishment of a Provisional Government, granting temporary authorities and waivers as outlined in this Declaration. This Provisional Government shall remain in effect until the House of Commons is summoned following the first General Election, at which time the Provisional Government shall be dissolved, and the regular operations of the Sovereign Order of Aether shall commence.

## Section I. Waiver of Nationality Requirements
During the Provisional Government period, standard requirements for the acquisition of Aether Nationality as outlined in Article IV, Nationality, of the Constitution may be waived at the discretion of the State Founders. This waiver allows for individuals who have not met the standard prerequisites for citizenship to participate in the establishment and functioning of the Provisional Government.

## Section II. Parliamentary Activities
Throughout the duration of the Provisional Government, the State Founders shall act as the House of Commons in all capacities, including passing legislation, subject to the standard restrictions stated within the Constitution. The State Founders shall also possess the authority to establish and appoint Members of Parliament, Ministries, and Offices as necessary for the effective functioning of the Provisional Government.

During the Provisional Government, the State Founders shall assume the responsibilities of the Council of Three as outlined in Article I, Section III of the Constitution. The State Founders shall collectively exercise executive power and work closely with the House of Commons, Ministries, and Offices to uphold the separation of powers and maintain the legislative and executive functions of the Government.

In recognition of the unique circumstances surrounding the Provisional Government, individuals may be permitted to fulfill multiple roles across Parliament, including within the House of Commons, Ministries, and Offices, as deemed necessary for the effective functioning of the Government.

## Section III. Suspension of Public Office Citizenship Requirement
For the duration of the Provisional Government, the requirement for individuals holding public office to possess Aether Citizen Nationality, as specified in Article I, Section IV of the Constitution, may be temporarily suspended at the discretion of the State Founders.

## Section IV. Ratification
This Declaration of 7 April 12023, also known as the Declaration of Provisional Government, shall remain in effect until the dissolution of the Provisional Government, which shall take place when the House of Commons is summoned following the first General Election. By signing this document, each State Founder voluntarily affirms their support and commitment to the establishment and operation of the Provisional Government as outlined herein.

Signed on this 7th day of April, 12023, by the State Founders of the Sovereign Order of Aether, whose signatures bear witness to their individual and collective dedication to the principles and objectives set forth in this Declaration.
